#The Glorious WTF-O-Vision!

This JavaScriopt code rummages through text and replaces certain words and phrases with other words and phrases. It's like a reverse Mad-libs.

See: http://matthewkastor.github.com/WTF-O-Vision/ for details, documentation, and a live demo.

Copy this branch and you will have a copy of the WTF-O-Vision and all its documentation. Look in the src folder if you want to snap up the code and play with it without reading the docs.

Disregard the `master` branch, it will not be updated.
