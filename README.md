#The Glorious WTF-O-Vision!

This code rummages through text and replaces certain words and phrases with other words and phrases. It's like a reverse Mad-libs.

See: http://matthewkastor.github.com/WTF-O-Vision/ for details, documentation, and a live demo.

You can download the gh-pages branch if you need a copy of the docs. https://github.com/matthewkastor/WTF-O-Vision/tree/gh-pages
